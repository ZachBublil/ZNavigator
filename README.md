# ZNavigator
ZNavigator integrates BottomNavigationView and manages the navigation between tabs and inner tabs.
Znavigator could make your bottom navigation work like YouTube's navigation, only one instance of  each tab exists and back button leads to the last tab instance.
The library also retain the fragments views so switching between tabs never recreate the tabs.
